# Domains & Data Products

## Overview of Domains and Data Products in Open Metadata

In Open Metadata, we've added support for Data Mesh with Domains and Data Products, enabling you to efficiently manage and organize your data assets.Here’s how you can leverage these features to enhance your data architecture and improve user experience:

## Organizing with Domains

Domains in Open Metadata allow you to categorize and manage your data assets, glossaries, teams, and other entities under a unified structure. This supports a decentralized data architecture by:

- **Grouping Related Data**: You can group related data assets within a domain, making it easier to manage and maintain them.
- **Streamlined Management**: By associating teams and glossaries with specific domains, you can streamline the governance and oversight of data assets.
- **Decentralized Control**: Each domain can be managed independently, aligning with the principles of a Data Mesh, where data ownership is distributed across different teams.

## Enhancing Usability with Data Products

Data Products in Open Metadata allow teams to package and present their data assets as products within their domains. This approach benefits data users by:

- **Centralized Access**: Data consumers can easily discover and access all Data Products available within their organization through the Explore page.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each Data Product comes with rich documentation, helping users understand the data’s context, usage, and governance.
- **Metadata Management**: Essential metadata, such as owner information, expert contacts, tags, and styling, can be captured and maintained for each Data Product, enhancing discoverability and usability.

## Domain-Only View for Simplified User Experience

To further enhance user experience, Open Metadata introduces a Domain-only View. This feature helps users by:

- **Focused Navigation**: Users can stay within a specific domain for all their data needs, reducing the complexity of navigating across multiple domains.
- **Enhanced Discoverability**: Within a domain, users can quickly find the data assets and products relevant to their work, improving efficiency and productivity.

## Implementing Domains and Data Products

1. **Setting Up Domains**:
   - Define your organizational structure and identify key domains.
   - Categorize your data assets, glossaries, and teams under the appropriate domains.
   - Assign ownership and governance responsibilities to relevant teams within each domain.

2. **Creating Data Products**:
   - Group related data assets from within a domain to form a Data Product.
   - Provide comprehensive documentation and metadata for each Data Product.
   - Ensure each Data Product has clear ownership and designated experts for support.

3. **Utilizing the Domain-only View**:
   - Encourage users to navigate and operate within their designated domains.
   - Provide training and resources to help users leverage the Domain-only View effectively.
   - Regularly update and maintain domain structures and Data Products to reflect organizational changes and evolving data needs.


By organizing your data assets with Domains and Data Products in Open Metadata, you can achieve a more structured and efficient data management system. This approach supports decentralized data architecture, simplifies user experience, and enhances discoverability and usability of data across your organization. Embrace these features to optimize your data strategy and empower your teams with better data tools.
